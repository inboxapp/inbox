# Nilas

#### The next-generation email platform.


The Nilas Sync Engine provides a RESTful API on top of a powerful email sync platform, making it easy to build apps on top of email. See the [full API documentation](https://www.nilas.com/docs/api#overview) for more details.



### Set up


1. [Install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

2. [Install Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

3. `git clone git@github.com:inboxapp/inbox.git`

4. `cd inbox`

5. `vagrant up`

    Feel free to check out the `Vagrantfile` while this starts up. It creates a host-only network for the VM at `192.168.10.200`.

6. `vagrant ssh`

    At this point you should be SSH'd into a shiny new Ubuntu 12.04 VM. The
    `inbox` directory you started with should be synced to `/vagrant`.

    If not, run `vagrant reload` and `vagrant ssh` again. You should see the
    shared folder now.

7. `cd /vagrant`

8. `bin/inbox-start`

And _voil√†_! Auth an account via the commandline to start syncing:

    bin/inbox-auth ben.bitdiddle1861@gmail.com

Because authentication uses a sample client key/secret by default, it is recommended that you use the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com) and the Windows Dev Center to create a new OAuth 2.0 Client ID.

For Google, add the Gmail, Calendar, and Contacts APIs, and then generate a *Client ID for Native Application*. Then, replace the sample credentials in `/etc/inboxapp/secrets.yml` and run `bin/inbox-auth your@email.com`.



## Provider compatibility

|  Provider  	|  Status      			| 	Details  |
|:------------	|:--------------------:	|:----------|
| Gmail 		|  :white_check_mark:	| Mail, Calendar, Contacts   |
| Google Apps 		|  :white_check_mark:	| Mail, Calendar, Contacts   |
| Microsoft Exchange | :large_blue_diamond: | Included in the [Nilas Developer Program](https://www.nilas.com/features)  |
| Other Providers   |  :white_check_mark:   | Mail  |

Please [create an issue](https://github.com/inboxapp/inbox/issues) if your mail provider is not supported, or if you want to see calendar and contacts support for a specific provider.

## Contributing

We'd love your help making Nilas better! Join the [Google
Group](http://groups.google.com/group/inbox-dev) for project updates and feature discussion. We also hang out in `#nilas` on `irc.freenode.net`, or you can email
[support@nilas.com](mailto:support@nilas.com).

Please sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.nilas.com/cla.html)
before submitting patches. (It's similar to other projects, like NodeJS or Meteor.)

We maintain strict code style, following [pep8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), the [Google Python style
guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html), and [numpy docstring
conventions](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt).

We standardize on single-quotes for strings literals e.g. 'my-identifier', but use double-quotes for strings that are likely to contain single-quote characters as part of the string itself (such as error messages, or any strings containing natural language), e.g. "You've got an error!".

#### Random notes

You should do `git config branch.master.rebase true` in the repo to keep your
history nice and clean. You can set this globally using `git config --global branch.autosetuprebase remote`.
