# Inbox

#### The next-generation email platform.


Inbox is a set of tools to make it simple and quick to develop apps and services on top of email.

## Getting Started

You can run Inbox almost anywhere. We've successfully built images for Docker, VMware Fusion, VirtualBox, AWS, and DigitalOcean. The easiest way to get started is to install from source within VirtualBox.


### Install from source

Here's how to set up a development environment running on your local machine:

1. [Install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

2. [Install Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

3. `git clone git@github.com:inboxapp/inbox.git`

4. `cd inbox`

5. `vagrant up`

    Feel free to check out the `Vagrantfile` while this starts up. It creates a host-only network for the VM at `192.168.10.200`.

6. `vagrant ssh`

    At this point you should be SSH'd into a shiny new Ubuntu 12.04 VM. The
    `inbox` directory you started with should be synced to `/vagrant`.

    If not, run `vagrant reload` and `vagrant ssh` again. You should see the
    shared folder now.

7. `cd /vagrant`

8. `bin/inbox-start`

And _voil√†_! Auth an account via the commandline to start syncing:

```
  bin/inbox-auth ben.bitdiddle1861@gmail.com
```


## Contributing

We'd love your help making Inbox better! Join the [Google
Group](http://groups.google.com/group/inbox-dev) for project updates and feature
discussion. We also hang out in `##inbox` on `irc.freenode.net`, or you can email
[help@inboxapp.com](mailto:help@inboxapp.com).

Please sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.inboxapp.com/cla.html)
before submitting patches. (It's similar to other projects, like NodeJS.)

We maintain strict code style, following [pep8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), the [Google Python style
guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html), and [numpy docstring
conventions](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt).

We standardize on single-quotes for strings literals e.g. 'my-identifier', but use double-quotes for strings that are likely to contain single-quote characters as part of the string itself (such as error messages, or any strings containing natural language), e.g. "You've got an error!".

#### Random notes

You should do `git config branch.master.rebase true` in the repo to keep your
history nice and clean. You can set this globally using `git config --global branch.autosetuprebase remote`.
