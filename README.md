# Inbox

#### The open source email toolkit.


Inbox is a set of tools to make it simple and quick to develop apps and services on top of email. It consists of:

- IMAP sync engine
- Gmail OAuth authentication
- MIME parsing and decoding
- Full text search indexing
- Queryable metadata store
- Full message body storage including attachments
- All UTF-8 and JSON sanitized
- Contacts list sync

These features are exposed via a clean REST API. See the [docs] (src/inbox/docs) folder for details.


## Getting Started

You can run Inbox almost anywhere. We've successfully built images for Docker, VMware Fusion, VirtualBox, AWS, and DigitalOcean. The easiest way to get started is to install from source within VirtualBox.


### Install from source

Here's how to set up a development environment running on your local machine:

1. [Install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

2. [Install Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

3. `git clone git@github.com:inboxapp/inbox.git`

4. `cd inbox`

5. `vagrant up`

    Feel free to check out the `Vagrantfile` while this starts up. It creates a host-only network for the VM at `192.168.10.200`.

6. `vagrant ssh`

    At this point you should be SSH'd into a shiny new Ubuntu 12.04 VM. The
    `inbox` directory you started with should be synced to `/vagrant`.

    If not, run `vagrant reload` and `vagrant ssh` again. You should see the
    shared folder now.

7. `cd /vagrant`

8. `cp config-sample.cfg config.cfg` to setup a default configuration file.

9. `sudo ./setup.sh` to install dependencies and create databases.

10. `export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)` to ensure that inbox executables can find the `inbox` package.

11. `bin/inbox-start`

And _voil√†_! Auth an account via the commandline and start syncing:

```
  bin/inbox-auth ben.bitdiddle1861@gmail.com
  bin/inbox-sync start ben.bitdiddle1861@gmail.com
```

## Contributing

We'd love your help making Inbox better! Join the [Google
Group](http://groups.google.com/group/inbox-dev) for project updates and feature
discussion. We also hang out in `##inbox` on `irc.freenode.net`. (Be patient,
IRC is not our primary dev channel.)

Please sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.inboxapp.com/cla.html)
before submitting patches. (It's extremely simliar to other projects, like NodeJS.)

We try to stick with pep8 and the [Google Python style
guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html).

For docstrings, we're using the [numpy docstring
conventions](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt).

We also group module imports separated by blank lines, starting with Python
standard library imports, followed by 3rd-party modules and then Inbox modules
(relative and absolute). Within these general groups, we group to the author's
preference of visual consistency.

#### Random notes

You should do `git config branch.master.rebase true` in the repo to keep your
history nice and clean. You can set this globally using `git config --global branch.autosetuprebase remote`.
