Title: Errors

  //Consider writing even more specific errors. Unless developers don't mind these. Hard to say if these are informative enough

Inbox uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

Code | Description
--- | --- 
200 | OK -- Everything worked as expected.
400 | Bad Request -- Missing a required parameter.
401 | Unauthorized -- No valid API key provided.
402 | Request Failed -- Parameters were valid but the request failed.
404 | Not Found -- The requested item doesn't exist.
429 | Too Many Requests -- Read more about [API Rate Limiting](#).
500, 502, <br/>503, 504 | Server errors --  An error occured in the Inbox server

For a full list of possible codes, we recommend the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).

Error bodies includes a JSON object with a standard set of attributes, including an `error_type` and a human-readable `error` string. These are designed to make debugging easier and allow for different handling of scenarios that produce the same HTTP status code.
