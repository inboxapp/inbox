Title: Contacts

The Inbox API provides access to the user's contacts, making it easy to add contact autocomplete, address book integration, and more to your application.

# Retrieving contacts

    GET https://api.inboxapp.com/n/<namespace_id>/contacts
    
    //Wait, yes I'd like to have access to their contacts but how do I do that? With the snippet above? Be more clear please.

Fetch the user's contact list. This API supports query parameters which make it easy to search the user's contacts. Available query parameters are listed below:

**Options:**

* `order`- If `order=rank`, return contacts in ranked order of relevance based
  on the user's mail data.
* `filter` - If given and if `order=rank` is passed, only return results containing this parameter as a substring of the contact's name or email address.
* `limit` - Maximum number of results to return. Defaults to 10. Set to 0 for no limit.
* `offset` - Zero-based offset to be used with `limit` for pagination of results.

**Sample Response:**

```
:::json
[
    {
        "name": "Ben Bitdiddle",
        "email": "ben.bitdiddle@mit.edu",
        "id": "8pjz8oj4hkfwgtb46furlh77",
        "namespace": "aqau8ta87ndh6cwv0o3ajfoo2",
        "object": "contact"
    },
    ....
]
```

Two calls to `/contacts?order=rank` are not guaranteed to return the same results, since the relative ranking of contacts may change over time. Clients that want to fetch all of a user's contacts should omit the `order` and `filter` parameters in order to get consistently-paginated results.


# Retrieving a single contact

    GET https://api.inboxapp.com/n/<namespace_id>/contacts/<contact_id>

Fetch data for the contact with the specified ID.

    //The tone of voice has changed in this document from the previous ones. Will have to be unified.

**Sample response:**

    "name": "Ben Bitdiddle",
    "email": "ben.bitdiddle@mit.edu",
    "id": "8pjz8oj4hkfwgtb46furlh77",
    "namespace": "aqau8ta87ndh6cwv0o3ajfoo2",
    "object": "contact"
}
```
