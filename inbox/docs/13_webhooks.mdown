Title: Webhooks

Webhooks allow your application to receive callbacks based on specific filter parameters.
 
    //I feel this should have a bit more infomration provided. I could just be a total newbie when it comes to this but you totoally lost me. How is this useful or important? The example response isn't much help.

# The webhook object

    GET https://api.inboxapp.com/n/<namespace_id>/webhooks/<webhook_id>

**Response:**

```
:::json
{
    "id": "1dp2eu6n25u3rpejmpfm67d8g",
    "object": "webhook",
    "namespace": "awa6ltos76vz5hvphkp8k17nt",

    "callback_url": "https://www.example.com/webhook_callback",
    "failure_notify_url": "https://www.example.com/webhook_failure",

    "include_body": true,
    "active": true,

    "to": "*@salesforce.com",
    "from": null,
    "cc": null,
    "bcc": null,
    "any_email": null,
    "subject": null,
    "thread": "8vvuy9octntkxdc944ogdi71i",
    "filename": null,
    "started_before": null,
    "started_after": null,
    "last_message_before": null,
    "last_message_after": null,
}
```

Note that the specified `callback_url` and `failure_notify_url` *must* support HTTPS. Attempts to create or modify a webhook with a non-https endpoint will fail.

# Creating a new webhook

    //What is this? Why would I want to create one?

    POST https://api.inboxapp.com/n/<namespace_id>/webhooks


**Sample post body**
```
:::json
{
    "callback_url": "https://www.example.com/webhook_callback",
    "failure_notify_url": "https://www.example.com/webhook_failure",

    "include_body": true,
    "active": true,

    "to": "*@salesforce.com",
    "from": null,
    "cc": null,
    "bcc": null,
    "any_email": null,
    "subject": null,
    "thread": "8vvuy9octntkxdc944ogdi71i",
    "filename": null,
    "started_before": null,
    "started_after": null,
    "last_message_before": null,
    "last_message_after": null,
}
```

* `callback_url` must be specified
* all other fields are optional
* `active` defaults to `true`
* `include_body` defaults to `false`
* all filter params default to `null`

# Starting and stopping a webhook

Webhooks can be stopped or restarted by issuing a PUT request to the webhook's
URI with the new value of the `active` parameter in the body.

    PUT https://api.inboxapp.com/n/<namespace_id>/webhooks/<webhook_id>

** Sample post body
```
{
  "active": false
}
```

All other properties of a webhook are immutable; to change the filters or
callback URL, delete the webhook and create a new one.

# Listing all webhooks

    //Again, don't just pose code, post some text content/context too. No matter how obvious it may be. It's good documentation experience and you want to be consistent too.
 
    GET https://api.inboxapp.com/n/<namespace_id>/webhooks

**Response:**
```
[
  <webhook_object>,
  <webhook_object>,
  <webhook_object>,
  ...
]
```
