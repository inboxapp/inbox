Title: Messages

Messages are a sub-object of threads. The content of a message is immutable (with the exception being [drafts](#drafts)). Inbox does not support operations such as move or delete on individual messages; those operations should be performed on the message's thread. All messages are part of a thread, even if that thread has only one message.

# Retrieving a Message

# Retrieving Many Messages

The messages endpoint supports [Filters](#filters), making it easy to return a subset of messages matching your needs. You should specify one or more filter parameters to narrow your request. For example, you can return messages from a specific sender, with a particular subject, etc.

```
:::xml
GET https://api.inboxapp.com/n/<namespace_id>/messages?<filter_parameters>
```

**Sample Response**


```
:::json
[
    <message_object>,
    <message_object>,
    <message_object>
]
```

# Retrieving Messages in a Thread

One of the filter parameters available on messages is `thread`. Given a `thread_id` value, the API call will will return all messages in the thread.

```
:::xml
GET https://api.inboxapp.com/n/<namespace_id>/messages/<message_id>?thread=<thread_id>
```

# Marking a message as unread

```
:::xml
PUT https://api.inboxapp.com/n/<namespace_id>/messages/<message_id>
```

```
:::json
{
    "unread": true
}
```
